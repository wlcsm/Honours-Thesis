Results are proved which compare run times for recognizing sets using this model (which has a fixed program) with a stored program model and with Turing machines. The main result, theorem 3, shows the existence of a time complexity hierarchy which is finer than that of any standard abstract computer model. An Algol-like programming language is introduced which facilitates proofs of the theorems.},

    % abstract={We present the algorithm to multiply univariate polynomials with integer coefficients efficiently using the Number Theoretic transform (NTT) on Graphics Processing Units (GPU). The same approach can be used to multiply large integers encoded as polynomials. Our algorithm exploits fused multiply-add capabilities of the graphics hardware. NTT multiplications are executed in parallel for a set of distinct primes followed by reconstruction using the Chinese Remainder theorem (CRT) on the GPU. Our benchmarking experiences show the NTT multiplication performance up to 77 GMul/s. We compared our approach with CPU-based implementations of polynomial and large integer multiplication provided by NTL and GMP libraries.},
