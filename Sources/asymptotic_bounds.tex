\section{The O(nlog n) bounds}
\label{sec:nlogn}

For integer multiplication

\begin{itemize}
\item Convert to a $\Z[x]$ problem of multiplying polynomials.
\item Reduce to a $d$-dimensional convolution over $\Z$
\item Reduce to approximate $d$-dimensional convolution over $\C$. Here we apply some bounds which show that we can approximate the solution with good accuracy, enough so that rounding to the nearest integer gives the correct answer
\item Recombine
\end{itemize}
