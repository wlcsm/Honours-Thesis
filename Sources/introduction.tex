Polynomial multiplication is a fundamental problem in applied algebra. It can use it to multiply integers and vice-versa. Is used in solving systems of polynomial equations, making Gr\"{o}bner bases, dividing polynomials etc. I recently found out it can be used in modelling cellular automata. Also can be used to evaluate DFT's through Bluestein's transform

This thesis focuses on studying and cataloguing the most popular advancements, starting the first improvement by Karatsuba in (XXXX) all the way to the most recent paper by Harvey and van der Hoeven for multiplying integers in $O(n\log n)$ time. A polynomials package has been developed alongside this project which implements many of the algorithms for the Rust programming language.
